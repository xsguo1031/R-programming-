This repository contains two folders. 

Project 1 folder shows the R code I wrote for my second research paper about scenario generation and financial portfolio optimization. 

PFG Project folder includes the R code we wrote for a capstone project. In this project, we created a pipeline to convert stocks to factor portfolios, and find the best asset allocation using Markowitz Mean-Variance model and Principal Component Analysis.
